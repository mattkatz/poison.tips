# Situation
Often someone thinks - "I could just let the crowd do the difficult work for me! That will be cheap!"
They might set up a public website where one can offer suggestions or report malefactors or report bugs.

# Strategy
Help them! Set up a script against their submission form to submit many things to them. Many, many things. Submit every legitimate thing possible. There is a cost to processing input and it may actually be hard to deal with a flow of low-quality information or to process a lot of information at once. 

# Examples
If an organization is looking for obscenity, you might help them by submitting quite a lot of obscenity. Perhaps sending a link to every publicly hosted copy of a book banned for obscenity is a nice thing to do.
