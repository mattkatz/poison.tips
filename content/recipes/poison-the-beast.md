# Situation
Often someone thinks - "I could just let the crowd do the difficult work for me! That will be cheap!"
They might set up a public website where one can offer suggestions or report malefactors or report bugs.

# Strategy
Help them! Set up a script against their submission form to submit many things to them.


Be very helpful - generate things that might be true! Surely they've got some system in place to detect good reports from false reports. By generating all possible reports and submitting them, you are helping to speed up the crowdsourcing.


Perhaps you should be reporting all members of [The Committee]({{< ref "the-committee.md" >}}) - either they have to be investigated or the committee has to acknowledge they are not subject to the same rules as everyone else.

# Counter Strategy

You should assume that good people will only be mildly helpful. Anonymous samaritans should be Rate Limited so they can't be too helpful.
