Problem - search engines are building a profile of you
You are writing a book about yourself every day. It's an autobiography of sorts. 
TODO: Insert a video of google search advertisements.

You will occasionally make a search - and Google will remember. You will search for symptoms - and Google will remember. You will search for your secret love's latest photos - and Google will remember. You will search for legal advice - and Google will remember.

Google is building a profile of you by looking at your searches. They remember every question you ask. They remember which results you clicked on. They are building a profile of you by looking at every advertisement you click. With the notable exception of DuckDuckGo, this is what all of the search engines do.

Solution - poison the database of searches

Track me not is an add-on for the Firefox Browser and it searches multiple sites for you all the time. So it asks the world many questions. It doesn't care about the answers. It also doesn't care what the questions are - it just pulls them randomly from news sites.

So what is it doing? It's laying a stream of cover for you. It is searching sites and baffling their algorithms with a barrage of constant and unrelated searches. The statistical value of any individual search becomes less and less. The corellation of searches becomes less and less.  You can hide in a forest of nonsense.
