### How to Contribute ###
The best way is to write a draft article. We'll be managing your contribution by [using a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). Read that for an overview of the steps to take.
You'll follow those steps to first [fork this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/), then you can add an article in the `_drafts` folder. Make sure your article is saved as `my-clever-article-title.markdown` in that folder.
