Databases are a fascinating new lifeform in the world. They must be valuable and hungry because legions of people are employed in the care and feeding of them.

Let's pretend that we don't want to be fed to a database. Let's pretend that we aren't interested in trading our history and privacy or our most intimate details for a listicle or for the privilege of ordering a book.

Can you just opt out? 

* You could install adblock plus. You'll have to see all the placeholders trying to shame you for not viewing advertisements.
* You could always surf in a "Private Window".
* You could set your browsers to send a 'Do Not Track' message that might be respected by websites.
* You could never save your payment info and never sign up as a member of an ecommerce site.
* You could chop up all your grocery store "loyalty" cards.

So, not really. If you wish to be part of the modern world and not a hermit you'll find yourself being a part of a database. 

Perhaps you'd rather be more assertive - make the database worthless. Also, fuck 'em.

You'll want some tips on doing that.
